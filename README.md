# Is it Busy? 


This project is done with association of Turku University of Applied Sciences. 

The main objective of this project to make a multi-node network sniffing application
using multiple raspberry pi's as our node deployments. each node will be streaming mac-address
data to a MQTT server where a GUI or Website will display the amount of mac-addresses connected
to the network. This will give users an idea of how many people are connected and a predicted 'business'
of the room is displayed.
